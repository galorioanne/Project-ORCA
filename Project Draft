PROJECT ORCA
Organize. Resolve. Coordinate. Align. 

Problem Statement
These days, despite having the technology, people still struggle to make schedules and plans that don't conflict with others. Also, using multiple platforms or websites to organize workload and flow is quite a hassle. 

Project Objectives
Project ORCA aims to put all the necessary tools for a better workflow in one program. Users may input their activities on a weekly calendar and it may check for date/time conflictions. 

Planned Features
Separate pages for tasks and schedules. 
Write down tasks. 
Weekly schedules. (Where the written tasks may be inputted in) 

Inputs and Outputs
#inputs
User name
Name of the schedule 
Input activity and time on the desired day (in the code this will be listed like a menu, but in the final it may contain cells instead.) 

#outputs
A visual of the schedule
May notify if activity time/date conflict each other (from other planners that were created within the user's space
